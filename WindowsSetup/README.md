# Windows Installation / Setup Scripts

Various helper scripts for automating my preferences and application setup
on Windows.

Currently aren't setup to run automatically with [install.ps1](../install.ps1).

General Idea:

 - 0X : Setting up Windows Features, only done once, requires reboots, etc.
 - 1X : Setup preferences, disable services, remove things, can be run
        multiple times.
 - 2X : Install applications
 - 99 : Cleanup operations
